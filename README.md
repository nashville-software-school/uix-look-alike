# UIX Look Alike

Exercise for UIX delivering HTML/CSS based on a design and considering how components comprise an overall product.

## Summary
You are going to build a site for Deina's Bites, a 100% natural cookie bakery. The site will include a home page, catalog page, item detail page, and a shopping cart with credit card feature. 

You are being given a prototeype to follow for content placement, component design, etc. There is a style guide with colors and fonts. And all the images have been provided. But the rest is up to you!

## Getting Started

> **Pro Tip:** A well-designed site has patterns - things that are reused and repeated across the entire site. And this is a ecommerce site: details are critical. Pay attention to font size, placement, alignment. White space is your friend. 

1. Follow the [prototype](https://9yg393.axshare.com/#g=1&p=home&c=1). 
1. Use the [style guide] (https://github.com/nashville-software-school/uix-look-alike/blob/master/style_guide.png)for fonts and colors. 
1. Create Firebase account for your team to use in this application.
1. Be sure to set your Firebase rules for indexing.
1. Make sure you follow the prototype and style guide **PRECISELY**. There is no room for creative tweaks or editorial changes. Ask questions if something isn't clear. 

## Technical Considerations
* User authentication using Firebase.
* The application must have CRUD functionality with the Firebase database.
* Consider encapsulating all Firebase calls into a single module.
* Use SASS to control your color themes.
* Incorporate a CSS grid framework

## Technology Requirements
* SASS 
* Grunt (with JSHINT) 
* Promises
* Browserify
* Grid framework of your choice
* Firebase for data storage and retrieval
