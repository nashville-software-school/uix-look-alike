# UIX Look Alike

Exercise for UIX delivering HTML/CSS based on a design and considering how components comprise an overall product.

## Summary
You are going to build a site for Deina's Bites, a 100% natural cookie bakery. The site will include a home page, catalog page, item detail page, and a shopping cart with credit card feature. 

You are being given a prototype to follow for content placement, component design, etc. There is a style guide with colors and fonts. And all the images have been provided. But the rest is up to you!

## Getting Started

> **Pro Tip:** A well-designed site has patterns - things that are reused and repeated across the entire site. And this is an ecommerce site: **details are critical**. Pay attention to font size, placement, alignment. White space is your friend. 

1. Follow the [prototype](https://9yg393.axshare.com/#g=1&p=home&c=1). 
1. Use the [style guide](https://github.com/nashville-software-school/uix-look-alike/blob/master/style_guide.png) for fonts and colors. 
1. Make sure you follow the prototype and style guide **PRECISELY**. There is no room for creative tweaks or editorial changes. Ask questions if something isn't clear. 

## Technical Considerations
* Use a style library to control your layout and colors.

## Technology Requirements
* ES6 Modules

## Deadline
* You have 24 hours to complete this site.
